# DockerNodeUtility

This is a utility docker container for all the node projects.

The container utility purpose is to initialise new npm projects without having to install npm in the system. You should only have to run the DockerNodeUtility only on initializing the project, thereafter you can run simple commands to run the docker container.

## Initialization of the npm package

You will only have to run this only once. Just run the docker instructions below

1. `docker-compose run --rm npm init`

## Install modules

1. `docker-compose run --rm npm install <module>`

## After installation

1. Keep the bind mounts
2. Add `CMD` to convert the installation into a normal docker container.

## Setting permissions

Docker defaults to root for creating volumes, the best way to tensure that volumes get created with the right user, the following lines are added on the compose file

> `user: "1000:1000"`

To get the correct User ID and group ID, type the following on the terminal.

`id` this will create an output as follows

```
uid={...}(xxx) gid={...}(xxx) ...
```

Take note of the uid and gid, then edit the compose.yaml file with the uid and gid, example `user: "uid:gid"`

### Still getting a problem with permissions

Not neat solution, run `chown 1000:1000 path/to/volume` to set permissions.

## Connecting to mongodb

For mongodb connection url, instead of using `localhost`, the correct name is now the name of the image, for the mondb image, this will be `mongodb`

## Multiple containers
